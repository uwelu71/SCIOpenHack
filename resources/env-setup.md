# Security, Compliance, and Identity OpenHack Execution Specifics

This document will discuss the prerequisites to run a Security, Compliance, and Identity (SCI) OpenHack. It includes assets you need to host/point to, coach resources, event structure, and TODOs for each section.

## Challenge resource deployment

OpenHack participants will create challenge personas and resources in Azure AD and Azure.

### TO DO
Each team will:
* Need to sign up for an Office 365 E5 trial account and associate an EMS E5 trial account and Azure trial subscription. This will create a single Azure AD directory and support the OpenHack's scenario that this is a single fictitious company using these Microsoft products.
* Create challenge personas and groups using a PowerShell script.
* Deploy resources in their Azure trial subscription.

#### Sign up for a Microsoft account and an Office 365 E5 trial subscription

In this task, you will create a new Microsoft account and use that account to sign up for an Office 365 E5 trial subscription.

1. Open an InPrivate or Incognito browser session and then browse to [https://outlook.com](https://outlook.com).

1. Select **Create free account**.

1. Complete the wizard to create a new Microsoft account.
    Use either outlook.com or hotmail.com as the suffix.

1. Download the user CSV file from [https://dev.azure.com/cseeest/OpenHack/_git/SCIOpenHack?path=%2Fresources%2Fsciohusers.csv&version=GBmaster](https://dev.azure.com/cseeest/OpenHack/_git/SCIOpenHack?path=%2Fresources%2Fsciohusers.csv&version=GBmaster)

    ```PowerShell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

    sciohusercreation.ps1

1. Open the Compliance Manager.

1. Complete or close the welcome wizard.

#### Launch Secure score

In this task you will open Secure score to start the collection of secure score data.

1. Browse to [https://security.microsoft.com](https://security.microsoft.com).

1. Open the Secure score.

1. Verify **Preparing score** is displayed.

#### Launch Advanced hunting

In this task you will open the Advanced hunting to prepare new spaces for data.

1. In the Microsoft 365 security center, select **Hunting** > **Advanced hunting**.

1. Verify the new spaces are being prepared for data.
   If the page fails to load, retry loading the page.

#### Create Azure resources

The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template located at [https://dev.azure.com/cseeest/OpenHack/_git/SCIOpenHack?path=%2Fresources%2Ftemplates%2Fazure-deploy-scioh-env.json&version=GBmaster](https://dev.azure.com/cseeest/OpenHack/_git/SCIOpenHack?path=%2Fresources%2Ftemplates%2Fazure-deploy-scioh-env.json&version=GBmaster) should be executed against a new resource group named **OpenHackRG** in the target Azure subscription.  The Azure resources are used throughout the OpenHack to provide basic elements used by the fictitious company.

There are no ARM template parameters to provide (resource names are hard-coded within the template).

Use the Microsoft Azure portal to create the resource group and deploy the custom template, or you may use the following commands:

```PowerShell
$location = eastus"
$resourceGroupName = "OpenHackRG"
$deploymentName = "azuredeploy" + "-" + (Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().ToString('MMdd-HHmmss')

New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName -Location $location -Force

New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -TemplateFile './azure-deploy-scioh-env.json' -Name $deploymentName -Verbose
```

#### Upgrade to Azure Defender

1. Under **Enable Azure Defender on 1 subscriptions**, verify your subscription is selected and then, at the bottom of the page, select **Upgrade**.

1. Under **Install agents automatically**, clear the checkbox associated with your subscription.
   Agent installation will occur during the OpenHack.

## Coach Resources

The success of your OpenHack is totally contingent on the preparedness of your coaches. Coaches should:

* Have attended an SCI OpenHack in the past and completed all challenges.
* Have reviewed the coach's notes for each challenge.
* Attend a coaches pre-day for the event.

Detailed coach's notes are available for each challenge in the **/resources/coaches/** folder.

## Event Structure

We have found an event-structure that works well for the SCI OpenHack.

### Pre-Day

SCI OpenHacks should have a pre-day to prep coaches.

The pre-day should:

* Walk coaches through any changes in the content. Many coaches won't have attended the event for some time, and it's vital that they understand the latest state of affairs.
* Set schedule expectations
* Make sure coaches understand when they need to be where
* Emphasize that stand-ups are mandatory
* Reset coach responsibilities expectations
* Emphasize that coaches should not give answers, but help unblock when teams are stuck
* Emphasize that coaches should play the role of the company CISO
* Emphasize that coaches should encourage inclusivity (ensure everyone has voice)
* Emphasize that coaches should encourage teamwork. Discuss how the team will share roles, workloads, responsibilities, etc.
* The goal should be for most teams to complete the monitoring challenge ("Challenge 7: Step up your monitoring").
* If teams are moving slower than expected, coaches should be more hands on
* If teams are moving faster than expected, coaches should feel free to ask probing questions

## Coach Stand-ups

We've found that having morning stand-ups and afternoon coach stand-ups helps ensure a positive experience.

### Morning Stand-ups

In the morning standup, the OpenHack lead should:

* Highlighting the expectations, pitfalls and recommendations for those challenges.
* Run through the expected challenges for the day,
* First day: challenges 1-3
* Second day: challenges 4-6
* Third day: challenge 7-9
* Remind coaches that if their teams are behind, they should be more hands on in order to accelerate progress.
* Discuss any blockers or concerns.
* Discuss any resolutions to problems brought up in the afternoon standup from the previous day.

### Afternoon Stand-ups

In the afternoon stand-up, the OpenHack lead should:

* Ask each coach to give a brief update, including
* The challenge number their team is on
* Any blockers or concerns
* The lead should use this information to determine if changes need to be made
* The lead should continue to encourage coaches to be more-or-less hands on based on their team's progress

During the last afternoon stand-up, the OpenHack lead should:

* Ask each coach to give a final update, including
* The challenge number their teams ended up on
* One high point
* One low point
* The lead should take note of this information to give an overall update to CSE
