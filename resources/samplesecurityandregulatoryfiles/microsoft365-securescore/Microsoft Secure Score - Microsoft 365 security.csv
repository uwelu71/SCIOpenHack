1,Require MFA for administrative roles,"Requiring multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative roles makes it harder for attackers to access accounts. Administrative roles have higher permissions than typical users. If any of those accounts are compromised, critical devices and data is open to attack.

2,Ensure all users can complete multi-factor authentication for secure access,"Multi-factor authentication (MFA) helps protect devices and data that are accessible to these users. Adding more authentication methods, such as the Microsoft Authenticator app or a phone number, increases the level of protection if one factor is compromised.",14.29%,"	0/9",Planned,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,We're not doing this now. Come back later
3,Enable policy to block legacy authentication,"Today, most compromising sign-in attempts come from legacy authentication. Older office clients such as Office 2010 don’t support modern authentication and use legacy protocols such as IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. Legacy authentication does not support multi-factor authentication (MFA). Even if an MFA policy is configured in your environment, bad actors can bypass these enforcements through legacy protocols.",12.70%,"	0/8",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
4,Do not expire passwords,"Research has found that when periodic password resets are enforced, passwords become less secure. Users tend to pick a weaker password and vary it slightly for each reset. If a user creates a strong password (long, complex and without any pragmatic words present) it should remain just as strong in 60 days as it is today. It is Microsoft's official security position to not expire passwords periodically without a specific reason, and recommends that cloud-only tenants set the password policy to never expire.",12.70%,"	0/8",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
5,Turn on user risk policy,"With the user risk policy turned on, Azure Active Directory detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. As an administrator, you can configure a user risk conditional access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level. For example, you can block access to your resources or require a password change to get a user account back into a clean state.",11.11%,"	0/7",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
6,Turn on sign-in risk policy,Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multi-factor authentication (MFA).,11.11%,"	0/7",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
7,Enable Password Hash Sync if hybrid,"Password hash synchronization is one of the sign-in methods used to accomplish hybrid identity. Azure AD Connect synchronizes a hash, of the hash, of a user's password from an on-premises Active Directory instance to a cloud-based Azure AD instance. Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one. Enabling password hash synchronization also allows for leaked credential reporting.",7.94%,"	0/5",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
8,Do not allow users to grant consent to unmanaged applications,"Tighten the security of your services by regulating the access of third-party integrated apps. Only allow access to necessary apps that support robust security controls. Third-party applications are not created by Microsoft, so there is a possibility they could be used for malicious purposes like exfiltrating data from your tenancy. Attackers can maintain persistent access to your services through these integrated apps, without relying on compromised accounts.",6.35%,"	0/4",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
9,Enable self-service password reset,"With self-service password reset in Azure Active Directory, users no longer need to engage help desk to reset passwords. This feature works well with Azure AD dynamically banned passwords, which prevents easily guessable passwords from being used.",1.59%,"	0/1",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
10,Turn on customer lockbox feature,Turning on the customer lockbox feature requires that approval is obtained for datacenter operations that grants a Microsoft employee direct access to your content. Access may be needed by Microsoft support engineers if an issue arises. There's an expiration time on the request and content access is removed after the support engineer has fixed the issue.,1.59%,"	0/1",To address,No,Yes,Apps,Exchange Online,12/8/2020,None,
11,Use limited administrative roles,"Limited administrators are users who have more privileges than standard users, but not as many privileges as global admins. Leveraging limited administrator roles to perform required administrative work reduces the number of high value, high impact global admin role holders you have. Assigning users roles like Password Administrator or Exchange Online Administrator, instead of Global Administrator, reduces the likelihood of a global administrative privileged account being breached.",1.59%,"	0/1",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
12,Designate more than one global admin,Having more than one global administrator helps if you are unable to fulfill the needs or obligations of your organization. It's important to have a delegate or an emergency account someone from your team can access if necessary. It also allows admins the ability to monitor each other for signs of a breach.,1.59%,"	0/1",To address,No,Yes,Identity,Azure Active Directory,12/8/2020,None,
13,Remove TLS 1.0/1.1 and 3DES dependencies,"Review all your clients to check which ones use TLS 1.0/1.1 and 3DES to communicate with Office 365. The goal is to upgrade your clients to move away from using weaker protocols and cipher. You can access a report showing all the TLS 1.0/1.1 and 3DES connections in your tenants grouped by user and agent information. After all your clients are migrated and the usage below is zero, you will be awarded full points. ",1.59%,"	1/1",Completed,No,Yes,Apps,Exchange Online,12/8/2020,None,
