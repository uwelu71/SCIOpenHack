# What’s in the toolbox  
***Resist the initial temptation to rush to the keyboard! This is the time to pause and think as a team about the challenge, what is expected, and how to optimize the team member skills to achieve success.***

## Reminders

- Use an InPrivate/Incognito window in your browser to avoid any confusion with any other credentials that you may use to access Azure or Microsoft 365.

- The credentials your team needs to access the Azure subscription assigned to your team are available on the OpenHack Environment tab.

## Challenge

In this challenge your team will collect a list of assets found in Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 that your team can use to assist in the discovery of security and compliance risks. Be sure to focus on the available tools the company has access to in their Office 365 E5 and EMS E5 subscriptions. The CIO wants to stay with Microsoft products at this time and would also like to leverage available trial products specifically for proof-of-concept projects. The team should include other Microsoft related security, compliance, and identity products in the list even if there is no subscription currently deployed.

In addition to tools that identify risk, you must also collect a list of methods that are used to implement and affect policy implementation. For example, creating Azure AD users can be done in the Microsoft 365 admin center or from the Azure Active Directory blade in Azure.  

The team should focus on the technical side for assessments and not the all-up risk management and compliance program which would include items like documentation of acceptable use policy.

Your team will present the list of tools and methods to the CISO and be able to describe how each can be used to protect or manage the organization’s security and compliance requirements.

## Additional requirements  

Contoso Mortgage has the following additional requirements:

- Azure Active Directory default security settings should not be used. The company intends to deploy additional security measures later.

- The company is very interested in protecting its intellectual property from potential loss due to malicious or inadvertent activities. For this, the team is to add the Microsoft 365 E5 Insider Risk Management free trial product to their subscription. The CISO would also like each user account to have an insider risk management licensed assigned to them.

- Assign team member accounts to the Insider Risk Management admin role.

## Success Criteria  

- Present your list of available security and compliance tools to include in a remediation plan and present your findings to the coach.

- Discuss your findings and how they can be used to mitigate risk or enhance Contoso’s security and compliance posture.

- Identify those additional capabilities of Microsoft Defender for Cloud that can be leveraged to protect the organization.

- Ensure Security Defaults are not enabled.

- Add Insider Risk Management to the subscription and assign the license to all accounts.

Your coach will discuss your assessment before you move on to the next challenge.
